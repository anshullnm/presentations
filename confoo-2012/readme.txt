Dear fearless reader, thank you for getting this far. The real time talk (real-time.key) comes in several parts. The brief Keynote slides stop at slide 12. At that point you want to look at the code in pace_example and the notes in pace_docs.rst this was live coding and was easier to have the notes in browser, not Keynote.

Each step of the live coding is a git commit, so you can either checkout the head, or check out each step.
